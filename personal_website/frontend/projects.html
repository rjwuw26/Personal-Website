            <h3>Personal Website with LLM Integration</h3>
            
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>This application introduces who I am in a professional and innovative way. It combines a website with an AI Model that allows users to learn about myself.</p>

            <h4>Motivation:</h4>
            <p>I wanted a project that went beyond a standard portfolio, something that demonstrates both unique frontend design and practical AI backend integration.</p>

            <h4>Key Highlights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a multi-page web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask).</li>
                <li>Integrated a Large Language Model (LLM) for dynamic interaction.</li>
                <li>Intuitive and modern UI design</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
            <p>I learned how to integrate an LLM backend with a responsive frontend, while also improving my ability to debug API pipelines and AI responses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Note: This AI feature is only accesible on a local level ergo issues with the model size and deployment limitations.</p>

        <div class="about-card card-left">
            <h3>MultiView Synchro (Class Project - Human-Computer Interaction)</h3>
            
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>Designed a prototype alternative to Synchro Studio that improved usability through enhanced tool discoverability and customizable workspace.</p>

            <h4>Motivation:</h4>
            <p>Our team of five identified two pain points in Synchro Studio's rigid interface, making it difficult for new and experienced users to efficiently locate tools and manage their workspace.</p>

            <h4>Key Highlights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted contextual inquiry and user interviews to uncover usability issues.</li>
                <li>Developed iterative prototypes, from sketches and paper mockups to high-fidelity Figma designs.</li>
                <li>Introduced a global search bar and flexible panel system for improved user control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
            <p>
                I strengthened my UX design skills by applying research methods, building interactive protoypes, and integrating feedback. 
                Throughout this project, I also gained valuable experience in group communication, role coordination, and collaborative problem-solving.

            <h3>Drones are Threatening Your Privacy and Security (Computer Ethics Paper)</h3>
            
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>This paper analyzes how the rise of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) introduce privacy risks while proposing ethical and policy-driven solutions.</p>

            <h4>Motivation:</h4>
            <p>I wanted to explore how rapid technological innovation can outpace laws and regulations, using drones as a case study of both convenience and risk in society.</p>

            <h4>Key Highlights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Discusses surveillance risks and unauthorized data collection from drones.</li>
                <li>Examines existing policy and regulatory gaps in current U.S law that permits such risks.</li>
                <li>Proposes redefined ethical frameworks and realistic solutions for policymakers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
            <p>I strengthened my technical writing skills in developing this paper for an academic audience and my research methods in connecting technical issues to ethical standards.</p>

        <div class="about-card card-left">
            <h3>Recipe Book (Full-Stack Web App)</h3>
            
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>To design and develop an efficient way to manage recipes with the use of CRUD operations across frontend and backend integration.</p>

            <h4>Motivation:</h4>
            <p>This project was built as part of my Client-Server Programming course to gain practical experince in connecting well-designed user interfaces with backend services and databases.</p>

            <h4>Key Highlights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).</li>
                <li>Built RESTful APIs to connect frontend (built w/ HTML, CSS) and backend (built with JavaScript) code.</li>
                <li>Utilizes simple database management using MySQL and XAMPP.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
            <p>I learned how to integrate frontend and backend systems into a cohesive full-stack application, while strengthening my debugging skills and API development for real-world use cases.</p>
