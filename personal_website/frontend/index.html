            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>B.S. in Computer Science and Systems, University of Washington Tacoma (2025)
                Coursework and projects centered on full-stack web development, databases, and applied NLP and machine learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My time at UW Tacoma taught me to combine analytical thinking with creative problem-solving — building solutions that are both functional and focused on the needs of the user.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, I enjoy long-distance running, creative writing, and team-based strategy games.
                These help me stay disciplined, think creatively, and collaborate — the same mindset I bring into development.
